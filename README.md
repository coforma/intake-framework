# &Partner's new project intake framework
In an effort to standardize the work we do, and who we work with, we've developed a framework to enable us to foster transparency, but also to ensure that we do not stray from our goals, vision, and mission. [Download the framework](https://github.com/prtnrs/intake-framework/blob/master/%26Partners_Framework%20for%20Choosing%20Project%20Partners.pdf)
